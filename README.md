- Fandango
- Other movie review sites (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Metacritic)

## Data Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed EDA to understand the structure and distribution of the data. This included visualizations and statistical summaries.

### Comparison Metrics

We used various metrics to compare the reviews, such as:
- Mean ratings
- Rating distributions
- Correlation between ratings

## Findings

Some key findings from our analysis include:
- There was a clear rating difference between displayed user-reviewed stars and real values on Fandango.
- Comparing KDE plots for all sites, Fandango clearly leans toward more favorable rating values.

## Conclusions

Based on our analysis, we concluded that:
- Fandango's displayed ratings are more favorable compared to the actual user-reviewed star values.
- There is a noticeable bias in Fandango ratings when compared to other movie review sites.
